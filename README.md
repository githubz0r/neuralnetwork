# neuralnetwork
Handcooked MLP for practicing coding skills etc. Currently just a regressor with 1 hidden layer.

I made this for fun and to prove to myself that I can understand some basic backpropagation etc. to alleviate the crushing feeling of worthlessness. However, given that this is only a simple task that every student should be able to do, it doesn't help at all and instead just makes me feel like I wasted my time.
